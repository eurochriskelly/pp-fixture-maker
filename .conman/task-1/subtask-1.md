I want to be able to edit team names. Not in place though, hovering over a teamname should display a edit icon which brings up a dialog and lets me change the name. the name should change globally and let me enter initials and a simple color icon for now. But color icon, I mean select a background color, select a foreground color, show the initialise on the little 'square icon'.

For a more elaborate icon U should be able to choose up to 3 colors and set a percentage for each and generate or chose a pattern for each of those colors.

Let's try first
